A no-install, no-login digital ink canvas that works everywhere: desktop
(mouse / trackpad) and touch devices (iPad, Android tablets, Apple Pencil, any
stylus, or a finger). Open the page and start writing.

Built with **React + TypeScript + Vite**, a native **Canvas 2D** drawing
surface, the **Pointer Events API** for universal input (with pressure), and
**Tesseract.js** (in-browser OCR) for handwriting → text — runs on every
device, no API key required.

## Features

**P0 — core inking**
- ✏️ Smooth freehand strokes via Pointer Events + `requestAnimationFrame`
- 🖊️ Pressure sensitivity where the device reports it (stylus / Apple Pencil)
- 🌐 One code path for mouse, touch, stylus, and finger
- 🧽 Stroke-based eraser (erases whole strokes on contact, not pixels)
- ↩️ Stroke-based Undo / Redo (full history stack)

**P1 — productivity**
- 🔤 Handwriting → text via in-browser OCR (Tesseract.js) — no key, no cost,
  works on every device incl. Safari & iPad (see [details](#handwriting-recognition))
- 🎨 Pen toolbar: 3 thicknesses, 8 preset colors + a custom color picker
- 📤 Export to **PNG** and **PDF** (`jsPDF`)
- 💾 Auto-save to `localStorage` on every stroke; restored automatically on load

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the printed URL (default <http://localhost:5173>). The dev server
binds to your LAN (`host: true` in `vite.config.ts`) so you can open the
**Network** URL on a real iPad or Android tablet on the same Wi-Fi to test
stylus / touch input.

### Build for production

```bash
npm run build     # type-checks, then builds to dist/
npm run preview   # serve the production build locally
```

## Handwriting recognition

Handwriting → text uses **[Tesseract.js](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js)**,
a WebAssembly OCR engine that runs **entirely in the browser**. No API key, no
account, no paid service. Click the **T** button in the toolbar to recognize
what you've written; the result appears in a panel at the bottom.

**There is nothing to configure, and it works on every modern browser** —
including Safari, iPad, and Chrome on macOS. The OCR language model (~a few MB)
is downloaded once from a CDN on first use and cached by the browser afterward,
so the first recognition is a little slower than subsequent ones.

How it works: because Tesseract is OCR (it reads images, not pen strokes), the
app rasterizes your ink into a clean, cropped, high-contrast bitmap (dark ink on
white) and feeds that to the engine. See
[`src/lib/recognition.ts`](src/lib/recognition.ts).

> [!NOTE]
> Accuracy is strongest on **neat / printed** handwriting. Very fast or messy
> **cursive** is harder for OCR. If you later need top-tier cursive/math
> accuracy, swap `src/lib/recognition.ts` for a cloud recognizer — its public
> surface is just `recognizeText(strokes)` and `isRecognitionSupported()`, so
> only that one file changes. Good options: **MyScript iink**
> (<https://developer.myscript.com/>), **Google Cloud Vision**, or **Azure Ink
> Recognizer**. For any cloud provider, proxy the call through a small backend
> so the API secret never ships in the client bundle.

## Project structure

```
src/
  components/
    Canvas.tsx       # pure drawing surface — forwards a ref, emits pointer events
    Toolbar.tsx      # floating pill: tools / sizes / colors / undo-redo / export
    TextPanel.tsx    # handwriting-recognition output panel
    icons.tsx        # inline SVG icon set
  hooks/
    useDrawing.ts    # all pointer logic, live rendering, eraser, history wiring
    useHistory.ts    # generic stroke-based undo/redo stack
    useLocalStorage.ts # versioned auto-save / restore
    useRecognition.ts  # async lifecycle for recognition calls
  lib/
    recognition.ts   # in-browser OCR (Tesseract.js) — rasterize ink + recognize
    recognitionError.ts # error type (split out so it doesn't pull in the engine)
    export.ts        # PNG + PDF export (offscreen render, code-split)
    render.ts        # canvas path/pressure rendering shared by live + export
  types.ts           # Stroke / InkPoint model, presets
  App.tsx            # composition + keyboard shortcuts
  main.tsx           # React entry
```

### Data model

A drawing is `Stroke[]`. Each `Stroke` holds `InkPoint[]` with `x`, `y`,
normalized `pressure` (0–1), and `t` (ms since the stroke began). Keeping raw
timed points means the same data feeds both smooth rendering *and* the
handwriting recognizer (which consumes per-point `{ x, y, t }`) with no rework.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `P` / `B` | Pen |
| `E` | Eraser |
| `⌘/Ctrl + Z` | Undo |
| `⌘/Ctrl + Shift + Z` or `Ctrl + Y` | Redo |

## Mobile / touch notes

- The canvas sets `touch-action: none` so finger drags draw ink instead of
  scrolling or pinch-zooming the page.
- `index.html` ships a locked viewport (`user-scalable=no`, `viewport-fit=cover`)
  and PWA-style status-bar meta tags for a full-bleed feel on iOS/Android.
- The canvas is rendered at `devicePixelRatio` for crisp ink on retina screens.
- On narrow screens the toolbar collapses to a single menu button that expands
  into an icon tray.

---

## Tech notes

- **Rendering:** committed strokes are repainted into a DPR-scaled 2D context;
  the in-progress stroke is drawn on top each animation frame for low latency.
  Pointer `getCoalescedEvents()` is used so fast strokes stay smooth.
- **Eraser undo:** an erase drag mutates a private working copy and commits a
  single history entry on pointer-up, so one drag = one undo.
- **Lazy heavy deps:** `jsPDF` (export) and `tesseract.js` (OCR) are both
  dynamically imported on first use, so neither bloats the initial page load —
  the canvas boots fast and the engines load only when you export or recognize.
